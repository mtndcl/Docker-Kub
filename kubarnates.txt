--Pod--

A Pod always runs on a Node

A pod is the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes.
 A pod encapsulates one or more applications.
 Pods are ephemeral by nature, if a pod (or the node it executes on) fails,
 Kubernetes can automatically create a new replica of that pod to continue operations.


 kubectl create -f kub.yaml
